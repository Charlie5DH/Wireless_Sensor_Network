## Notebooks explanations 

**Arima Time Series Forecasting** notebook contains the forecasting of the temperature variable of a module using ARIMA method.

**Data_Exploration_WSN** notebook is an exploratory data analysis of all the features of the Dataset, including RSSI data. It's better to see the exploratory data analysis by separate.

 **Training_on_WSN** is to try different machine learning and deep learning algorithms. Solve classification problems with the data. 

**RSSI_Data_Exploration** is an exploratory data analysis of the RSSI data.

**Anomalies** notebook is for anomaly detection in this dataset, trying methods like SVM, IsolationForest, LSTM and LSTM + Autoencoders.

**Modules_Data_Exploration** is for exploratory data analysis of other features, like temperature. Don't include RSSI data.

**.py** files are custom modules to import in notebooks

**Time Series Analysis in Temperature** Analysis of temperature as time serie. Trend, Seasonality, Forecasting with SARIMA.
